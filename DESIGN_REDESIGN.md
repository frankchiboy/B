# Revised Visual Design Plan

This update rebuilds the entire visual style with a light, vibrant palette and modern typography. The accompanying sample HTML and CSS files illustrate the approach.

## Layout
- Utilize a 12‑column grid with generous whitespace for a clean, airy feel.
- Keep the header and hero sections full‑width and let cards sit on soft shadows.
- Align interactive elements consistently to maintain a tidy rhythm.

## Color Scheme
- Background `#FDFDFD` with white surfaces for cards and header.
- Text color `#333333` for strong readability.
- Primary color `#6C63FF` (soft violet) for navigation highlights.
- Secondary color `#FF6584` (salmon) for buttons and accents.
- Accent color `#F0C808` (warm gold) for calls to action.
- Gradients may blend the primary and secondary colors for hero overlays.
- Overlays and modals use 0.6–0.8 opacity to add depth without clutter.
- Avoid heavy translucency that would diminish contrast.
- Headings set in **Poppins** with bold weights.
- Body text in **Source Sans Pro** for a friendly, legible appearance.
- Maintain at least 1.5 line height and strong color contrast.
- Employ 24 px vector icons from libraries like Font Awesome.
- Use large hero images with a semi‑transparent gradient overlay.
- Favor modern image formats such as `webp` and keep graphics light and flat.

## Additional Notes
- Components should remain modular so the theme can evolve with ease.
- Consider introducing a CSS framework when the project scales to ensure consistency.
- Headings: `Roboto` or a similar sans-serif font, using bold weights for emphasis.
- Body text: `Open Sans` or another clean sans-serif font for readability.
- Maintain sufficient contrast between text and background for accessibility compliance.

## Imagery and Icons
- Use 24px icon grid for consistency across the interface.
- Use vector-based icons with a consistent line weight. Prefer open-source icon sets such as Font Awesome or Feather Icons.

- Ensure images are optimized for web performance. Prefer modern formats like `webp`.
- Hero sections may use full-width photos with a semi-transparent color overlay.
=======
- Ensure images are optimized for web performance. Consider using `webp` format where supported.

- Establish a cohesive illustration style: flat graphics with minimal shading.

## Future Implementation Notes
- As the project grows, incorporate a style guide or CSS framework (e.g., Tailwind, Bootstrap) to enforce visual consistency.
- Keep components modular to allow easy theme adjustments if design requirements evolve.
